I ran into a ton of issues while trying to get forgottenserver and otclient working. This doc contains the problems and solutions.

- Uniform Server Zero 13.3.2, mentioned by the OTS Guide, doesn't have a new enough version of PHP to run the ZNote AAC site.

- Tried versions 14 and 15. PHP version problem is fixed, but it stops at a 500 error.
    Apache server log: Uncaught mysqli_sql_exception: Access denied for user 'tfs13'@'localhost'
    Apparently it's supposed to also generate a database schema to add for the website's tables, but it isn't.

- Tried ZNote AAC versions 2 and 1.6, same issue on both.

- Tried using the schema from this post, but it failed to import (error about '$time') https://otland.net/threads/need-help-with-my-website.233437/post-2250826

- Searched for a commit mentioning the schema. Found https://github.com/Znote/ZnoteAAC/commit/a54d001e771fd5dd03e03b4403d808924dc385d3 which led me to engine/database/znote_schema.sql
    Running the commands from that file added the needed tables
    
- Site error: "Configuration error! Cannot save cache to memory, but it is configured to do so."

        Changes were already present, issue still persists.
    Doesn't seem to block you from creating an account/character

- otclient docs are missing openssl in dependency list
    .\vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows
    
- otclient requires finding spr/dat files elsewhere
    otland thread "Where can I download Tibia Client 10.98 safely?"
    
- otclient needs server port

- The towns that are selectable when creating a character are all invalid.
    Pick one, then in phpMyAdmin go to: players -> <character name> -> Edit, then scroll down and change the town to 1.

- The effect drawing algorithm is broken for certain area patterns.
